# Proyecto1-Algoritmos
Turing machine emulator for a Fibonacci algorithm

## How to run
Run using the following command under the src folder<br>
```bash
python main.py
```

## Libraries needes
You may need to install the following libraries for it to properly display Fibonacci computation stats<br>
```bash
pip install numpy==2.1.3 matplotlib==3.10.0
```

### Turing Machines Included
There are 4 Turing Machines.<br>
1. fibonacci.yml is unfinished to compute Fibonacci numbers, not suitable to use since it fails.
2. fibonacci2.yml computes Fibonacci numbers.
3. structure.yml checks a^nb^nc^n for n >= 1
4. structure2.yml inverts symbols 0 and 1. For example 0101 ends up as 1010
