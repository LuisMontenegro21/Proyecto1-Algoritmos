# Proyecto1-Algoritmos
Turing machine emulator for a Fibonacci algorithm

## How to use
Run using the following command under the src folder<br>
```bash
python main.py instructions/<Turing YAML>
```

## Libraries needes
You may need to install the following libraries for it to work using pip<br>
```bash
pip install numpy==2.1.3
pip install matplotlib==3.10.0
```

### Turing Machines Included
There are 3 Turing Machines.<br>
1. The fibonacci.yml computes Fibonacci numbers.
2. The structure.yml checks a^nb^nc^n for n >= 1
3. The structure2.yml inverts symbols 0 and 1. For example 0101 ends up as 1010
